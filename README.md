# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
It will read a book and provide the number of words and number of characters inside of a book.

1. Create a new folder in the same file as the README, place all of the desired books into this file as .txt
2. Open the console and enter cd bookbot (assuming you haven't changed the name of this folder. If you have, change "bookbot" for the current file name)
3. Enter python3 main.py <path_to_book> (<path_to_book> is the name of the folder that holds the books)
4. Profit! (hopefully)

I will likely not be updating anything relating to bookbot if a new python update breaks everything.
